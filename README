# DAG Drawing App
This is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Drawing Application that allows users to create, edit, and visualize complex causal relationships. It's built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Vis.js, providing a user-friendly interface for creating and managing DAG projects.

## Features
- Create and edit nodes and edges in a graph
- Save and load projects
- Export and import graphs as JSON
- Suggested nodes for quick addition
- Admin panel for user and project management
- AI-assisted graph generation (for admin users)
- User authentication and authorization
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- A modern web browser

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/federicoandreis/CollaborativeDAG
cd CollaborativeDAG

2. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///your_database.db
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

Replace `your_secret_key_here` with a secure random string, and `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key if you want to use the AI-assisted graph generation feature.

5. Initialize the database:
flask db upgrade

## Running the Application
1. Start the Flask development server:
flask run

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Register a new account or log in with existing credentials

## Usage
1. **Creating a Graph**: 
- Use the "Add Node" button to create new nodes
- Use the "Add Edge" button to create connections between nodes
- Right-click on nodes to add annotations
2. **Saving and Loading Projects**:
- Enter a project name and click "Save Project" to save your work
- Click on a project name in the "Your Projects" list to load it
3. **Exporting and Importing Graphs**:
- Use the "Export Graph" button to download your graph as a JSON file
- Use the "Import Graph" button to load a previously exported graph
4. **AI-Assisted Graph Generation** (Admin only):
- Enter a causal link prompt in the admin input area
- Click "Generate Graph" to create an AI-generated annotated graph

## Admin Features
To access admin features:
1. Register a new account
2. Use a database management tool to set the `is_admin` field to `True` for your user in the database
3. Log in with your admin account to access additional features like user management and AI-assisted graph generation
